# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java
This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java with a modern graphical user interface built using Java Swing.<br>
The game offers two modes: 
* Player vs. Player - Two players can take turns playing on the same computer.
*  Player vs. Computer - Play against a simple AI that makes decisions based on predefined rules

***
The FlatLaf Dark theme is used for the visual appearance, giving the application a sleek and modern dark mode design. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making the game enjoyable and accessible for all ages.
This project is a great example of how to use Java Swing for desktop application development and how to implement basic AI logic in games. <br><br>
